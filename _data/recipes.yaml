  problem: "you have events in a Kafka topic, and you want to filter some of them out so that only those you're interested in appear in another topic."
  introduction: "Consider a topic of user events. Each has a variety of attributes, like the user's name, favorite number, and favorite color. In this recipe, we'll write a program that creates a new topic which only contains events where the user's favorite color is green."

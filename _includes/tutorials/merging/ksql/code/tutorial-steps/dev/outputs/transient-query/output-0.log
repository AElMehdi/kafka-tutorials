Pull queries don't support LIMIT clauses. Refer to https://cnfl.io/queries for info on query types. If you intended to issue a push query, resubmit with the EMIT CHANGES clause

Query syntax in KSQL has changed. There are now two broad categories of queries:
- Pull queries: query the current state of the system, return a result, and terminate. 
- Push queries: query the state of the system in motion and continue to output results until they meet a LIMIT condition or are terminated by the user.

'EMIT CHANGES' is used to to indicate a query is a push query. To convert a pull query into a push query, which was the default behavior in older versions of KSQL, add `EMIT CHANGES` to the end of the statement before any LIMIT clause.

For example, the following are pull queries:
	'SELECT * FROM X WHERE ROWKEY=Y;' (non-windowed table)
	'SELECT * FROM X WHERE ROWKEY=Y AND WINDOWSTART>=Z;' (windowed table)

The following is a push query:
	'SELECT * FROM X EMIT CHANGES;'

Note: Persistent queries, e.g. `CREATE TABLE AS ...`, have an implicit `EMIT CHANGES`, but we recommend adding `EMIT CHANGES` to these statements for clarify.
